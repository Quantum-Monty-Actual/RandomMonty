What the Numbers Say

Ran 1M trials each of Knowledgeable Monty (knows car location, reveals a goat) and Random Monty (picks randomly, discards car reveals), with the player always switching. No tweaks, no proxies—just the base setup:

    Knowledgeable Monty: Switch win rate = 66.72%.
    Random Monty: Switch win rate = 50.01%.

Expected Behavior

Classical Monty Hall predicts a 2/3 win rate (~66.7%) for switching in both cases:

    Knowledgeable Monty forces the 2/3 odds by always revealing a goat.
    Random Monty, after discarding car reveals, should still hit ~66.7%—car’s equally likely behind the two unchosen doors, and a random goat reveal preserves the 2/3 advantage.

What’s Normal

    66.72% aligns with 66.7% (1M trials, minor variance expected).

What’s Off

    50.01% is nowhere near 66.7%. It’s a coin flip, not 2/3. In 1M valid trials, that’s a 16.7% drop—too big for chance.

Possible Meanings

    Code Error: Logic might mishandle Random Monty’s discards or switches. But 1M valid trials per condition were logged—counts hold up.
    Statistical Artifact: 1M trials should stabilize near 66.7%, not plunge to 50%. Two runs (one prior at 49.96%) suggest it’s not a fluke.
    Something New: Random Monty’s lack of knowledge could alter the odds—retrocausality, observer effect, or an unseen bias? No intent proxy here; this is raw.
